OBJECTIVE: TO UNDERSTAND DIFFERENT OPERATORS AND DATA TYPES IN C.

THEORY: Explain different datatypes and operators in C.

PRPGRAMS:

1. WAP to enter days and convert days into years, weeks and days. (Hint: years = days / 365, weeks = (days % 365) / 7, days = days - ((years * 365) + (weeks * 7))
2. WAP to find the largest number using ternay operators.
3. WAP to take an integer number from user and display whether the given number is positive, negative or zero.
4. WAP to check whether the number is divisible by (5 and 8) or not.
5. WAP to enter an integer number and find its cube root.
