OBJECTIVE: TO UNDERSTAND FUNCTION IN C.

THEORY:
	- Definition
    - Types
	- List of Syntax of each type

    Recursive Function
    - Definition
    - Syntax

PROGRAM:

1. WAP to ask user a number and find its square root using library function.
2. WAP to ask user the length, breadth & height of a box. Then create a function volume() to calculate volume of a box by using following function types;
    - with return type, with arguments
    - with return type, without arguments
    - without return type, with arguments
    - without return type, without arguments
3. WAP that contains findarea() and findvolume() function to find area and volume of a circle of radius r, define PI = 3.14 as MACRO.
4. WAP to find sum of n natural numbers using recursive function.
5. WAP to print the fibonacci series upto n terms using recursion.
6. WAP to find factorial of any number using recursion.
